Welcome to my github-pages.
I am Reza Mohammadi, and I am in my 4th year of studying Electrical Engineering at IKIU University in Iran.
I'm so interested in Hardware digital design and embedded systems, also interested in AI and Machine Learning.
I spent my time as a FPGA developer and since there I realized that I love this field of study.
SO, here I share what I Learn & what I Do!

NOTE: I will be so happy if you share any recommendation about anything.
